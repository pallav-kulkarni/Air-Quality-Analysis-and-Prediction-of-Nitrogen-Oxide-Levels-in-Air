# Air-Quality-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Nitrogen-Oxide-Levels-in-Air
Contains the responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city. Hourly responses averages are recorded along with gas concentrations references from a certified analyzer. We have to predict the level of Nitrogen Oxide(NOx) in air.
