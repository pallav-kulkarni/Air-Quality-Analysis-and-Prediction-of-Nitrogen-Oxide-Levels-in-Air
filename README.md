# Air Quality Analysis and Prediction of Nitrogen Oxide Levels in Air
Contains the responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city. Hourly responses averages are recorded along with gas concentrations references from a certified analyzer. We have to predict the level of Nitrogen Oxide(NOx) in air.
There are many poisonous gases such as Carbon Monoxide,
Nitrogen Oxide, Methane, Sulfur Dioxide, etc in the polluted air
which is harmful not only to human beings but also animals.
With the use of machine learning algorithms, we can predict
Nitrogen Oxide level in air.
• The data was acquired from the University of California
Irvine(UCI) Machine Learning Repository
• Used Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data cleaning,
data preprocessing and EDA
• Applied the pipeline of algorithms like Multiple Linear
Regression, Decision Tree Regression,Random Forest
Regression, XGBoost Regression, etc to predict Nitrogen Oxide
Level in Air and obtained around 94% accuracy on test data.
